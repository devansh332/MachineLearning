'''
Vectors in Computer science is different then that of in physics

Vector in Computer science represent attributes of a object

For Ex :

Lets take house as an object then we can find some attribute of the house

Area              [ 12,
number of beds       3,
number of baths      2,
total cost         200,]

this vectos has 4 dimension on which it can be compared with other similar objects

'''
import numpy as np

House_Vector = np.array([12, 3])
print(House_Vector)
